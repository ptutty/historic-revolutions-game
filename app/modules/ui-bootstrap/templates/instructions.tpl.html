<p> Revolutions are the product of a combination of factors, in differing proportions. In this game you can play as either a ruler or a revolutionary and decide which factors to play to either cause a revolution to break out or to put the revolution down. There are six possible historical revolutions scenarios that will be given to you based on whether you are a ruler or revolutionary and the difficulty level you choose.</p>

<p>For example, taking a factor such as “The urban masses” you will also be required to give it a rating on a sliding five-point scale depending ranging from:</p>

<p><em>Contented, in full employment, in a society allowing social mobility </em></p>
<p><em>Starving, impoverished, in a society that restricts opportunity</em></p>

<p>Factors have secret weighing depending on the type of revolution scenario. Some are more important than others in their impact on putting the fire of revolution out or starting a mass uprising. </p>
